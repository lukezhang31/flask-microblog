Chapter 11 - Bootstrap with Flask

In this unit, I explored Flask by completing the practice activities from chapter 1-9 of the Flask Mega Tutorial.
My summative lab was to complete the tutorial in chapter 11 and implement Bootstrap into my existing flask web application. 
I also went beyond and included my own quality of life changes to improve the user experience like adding follower/following pages and integrated the option to follow and unfollow others within their posts.
